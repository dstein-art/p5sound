h3 P5 Basics - Terminology
p You don't need anything to get started. Just a browser.
p <b>Algorithm</b>: series of steps to solve a problem
p <b>Syntax</b>: Syntax can be thought of as the grammar and punctuation of the instructions that we provide to a computer. Different programming languages have different syntax.
| We will be working with the <b><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">Javascript</a></b> language and the <a href="https://www.p5js.org">P5.js</a> library
p <b>Javascript</b> is the programming language that comes with most browsers. It is one of the most common programming languages.
p <b>Libraries</b> can be thought of as an add-on to a programming language that introduces additional functionality.
p <b>P5.JS</b> is a library that makes it easy to do creative coding with Javascript
p Check out P5.js <a href="https://p5js.org/community/">community statement (https://p5js.org/community/)</a>
p <b>Sketch</b> - a name commonly used to describe a P5.JS computer program. In other words, a sketch is a simple program or application.

h3 Hello World - Our first P5 Program

p Letâ€™s start writing code

p Syntax is the rules that define the structure of the computer language. 
| In the following example, we look at the command to create a P5 canvas. 
| Like in a painting, a canvas usually contains everything that we will
| draw within our program, essentially the output of our program. In P5,
| a canvas can be a size that we define. 
| In this example, createCanvas is a function that takes two numbers as arguments, a width and a height.
p
p The syntax of this command involves the function name, arguments, parenthesis, commas and a semicolon.When coding, following the correct syntax of a programming language is important as it is the syntax that the computer can interpret what you are asking it to do. In this example, the parenthesis and commas separate the parameters from the function name. A semicolon indicates that the function is complete:
